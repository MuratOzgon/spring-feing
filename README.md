# Mastering Microservice Communication with Spring Cloud Feign - My Journey

This repository showcases my project developed as a part of the "Mastering microservice communication with Spring Cloud Feign" course on Udemy. Through this course, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of creating resilient microservices using Spring Cloud and Feign.

## My Learning Overview
This project is a testament to my journey through the course, where I built a microservice system emphasizing resilient HTTP communication. My focus was on implementing and understanding the following key concepts:

- **Feign and Spring Cloud OpenFeign**: Mastering request and response mappings using annotations to ensure efficient microservice communication.
- **Advanced Feign Techniques**: Including Feign logging, creating base clients, and utilizing request interceptors.
- **Error Handling**: Customizing error responses and exploring maintainable error handling strategies with Spring Cloud OpenFeign.
- **Resilience with Resilience4J**: Implementing error and slowness-based circuit breaking, and integrating these with Eureka for service resolution.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Understanding request timeout options, following redirects, and managing async HTTP communication.
- **Monitoring and Metrics**: Exposing key metrics through Dropwizard, Micrometer, and Actuator for better system observability.
- **Load Balancing and Testing**: Implementing client-side load balancing and conducting extensive integration testing of Feign clients and circuit breakers.

## Project Highlights
- **Eureka Integration**: Demonstrating how Feign clients can efficiently resolve services with Eureka.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing Feign client fallbacks for improved fault tolerance.
- **Traffic Management**: Techniques to cut off traffic when requests are taking too long, using Resilience4J.
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing covering various aspects of Feign clients and load balancing.

## How to Run


## Further Exploration
I am continuously working on enhancing this project by exploring more advanced features and keeping up with the latest trends in microservice architecture.
